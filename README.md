This a game where you have nine tiles and each tile there is a hole where the mole can pop out and the goal is to whack them all by clicking on it to make the game more fun we turned it into a mario themed game for each hole we have a pipe and this is a mole from the mario franchise and we also have the pirannah plant, so basically the goal of the game is to tap on the mole everytime it comes out of the pipe without tapping on the piranha plant.
